## OPNsense starterkit

You want to either quickly 

1. Try [OPNsense](https://opnsense.org). See below 'Trying OPNsense'.
2. Or build an image for your infrastructure right from the ISO / from scratch. See [the build guide](build/README.md).
3. Or start developing opnsense with one line, see [the development quicksetup guide](https://github.com/EugenMayer/packer-opnsense/tree/master/development)
4. Test the current most rest opnsense development version without any effort? Check [the development quicksetup guide](https://github.com/EugenMayer/packer-opnsense/tree/master/development) - you get a "from source" version after running 1 command.
